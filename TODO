Code Documentation
#doc

Well I did not do that much about code documentation so far. For now this is
probably the most important thing on the to-do list.

Conditional Request Processing
#ajax

Need more controllers/request handlers for various cases:

    1.Restrict access to specific functions if permission level is too low.

    2.Deny specific requests in general. (use bitmask, $forbidden & $request)

    3.Allow only specific requests. (use bitmask, $allowed & $request)

Keep the default handler (dato_AJAX) if you do not need crp.

Limited Selection
#list

Selecting all entries from a table is actually unusual. Default queries for
data retrieval in order to populate a list or an overview should contain
following conditions and options:

    1.Either something like "WHERE id < :id ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT :limit"

    2.or something like "WHERE id > :id ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT :limit".

The specified id must be either from the first or the last item of the current
list page while scrolling to the left or to the right respectively.

Omit the condition in order to get the data for the first page.
________________________________________________________________________________
Composite Keys
#sql#ajax

After inserting a new row you can only get the lastInsertId, but of course this
does not work with composite keys. Need a workaround here. Maybe retrieve last
row number and fetch the key after insertion.
