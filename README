3. Abstract

The idea behind Data Toxin is to create a standard for cross platform
scaffolding for automating repetitive tasks like creating database tables,
corresponding SQL queries, models/data access objects, controllers/server-side
request handlers, structures for (graphical) user interfaces, AJAX stuff or any
kind of client-side HTTP request handlers.

Check the concept folder to learn more about dato.


4. Demo Installation

At the moment only the PHP and JavaScript based parts are available, so you will
need a web server like Apache HTTP Server or just use XAMPP for testing on
localhost.

4 easy steps:

    I.  Just put the whole project folder (dato) into a folder which can be
        accessed by using HTTP requests, if you are using XAMPP just put it in
        the htdocs folder.

    II. Change the configurations in core/php/dato_config.php to match your
        database settings.

    III.Open your web browser and navigate to:
        relative URL: demo_ui
        absolute URL: [domain][/path to dato folder]/dato/demo_ui
        XAMPP htdocs: localhost/dato/demo_ui
        
    IV. Click the button (BUILD STUFF), refresh the page and let's go.
        Check concept/screenshots/prototype to see how it could look like.
